# Loss Liability Declaration Poll - May 18, 2020

The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of the community which the community can use to signal whether to move ahead with a plan to provide compensation to vault holders.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance)) will be active for 7 days beginning on Monday, May 18 at 4 PM UTC.

## Statement

Risks of vault total loss were well documented in multiple places. Maker governance does not accept liability for any past losses experienced by any vault holder, nor accepts liability for future losses.

### Implications

Acceptance of this statement does not preclude the possibility that Maker governance could, in a beneficent gesture, issue compensation for losses in special circumstances. Acceptance of this statement merely indicates that Maker governance has no obligation to issue any compensation for losses.
